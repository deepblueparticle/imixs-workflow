# How Imixs-Workflow works

Imixs-Workflow is an **open source workflow engine** for a human-centric business process management (BPM). Human-centric BPM means to support human skills and activities in a task oriented and event driven way. The **Imixs-Workflow project** provides a powerful framework to model business logic for Business Applications and BPM Solutions. 
The Imixs-Workflow engine can either be embedded into a Java Enterprise Application, or can be run as a service in a microservice architecture.

## Imixs Microservice

Imixs-Workflow provides a Rest Service API to encapsulates the Imixs-Workflow Engine into a microservice. In this architectural style the workflow engine can be bound to any business application, independent from the technology behind. Business logic can be changed without changing a single line of code.

The [Imixs-Microservice project](https://github.com/imixs/imixs-microservice) provides a Docker Container to start a Imixs-Workflow instance with a single command. 


## BPMN 2.0

Imixs-Workflow is based on the [BPMN 2.0 modeling standard](http://www.bpmn.org/). To create a Imixs-Workflow model the
powerful Eclipse based modeling tool [Imixs-BPMN](./modelling/) can be used. To install Imixs-BPMN see the [installation guide](./modelling/install.html).

With BPMN 2.0 a business process can be described from different perspectives.
In Imixs-Workflow the process status is described with the BPMN element '_Task_'. 
The status change between the Task elements is defined by BPMN element '_Event_'.

This type of modeling is also known as event-driven modeling. You can find more examples in the section "[How to Model](.//modelling/howto.html)".



## The Actors

Imixs-Workflow is supporting human skills, activities and relieves collaboration in a task-oriented manner.
Each process instance can be assigned to different actors. 
The main objective is to support the human actors and provide them with relevant information about the business process. The workflow engine ensures that the business process is aligned to predetermined business rules:
 
  * Who is the owner of a business process
  * Who is allowed to access and modify the data
  * Who need to be informed
  
In that way Imixs-Workflow assists users in starting a new process, finding and processing open tasks and to complete current jobs. The Workflow Engine automatically routes open tasks to the next actor and notifies users about open tasks depending on the current process definition. 

Each business process can involve different users to interact with the Workflow Management System.
These users are called the *actors*. An Actor can either start, update or read a process instance and also the embedded business data
Imixs Workflow allows you to assign any kind of business data with a running process instance.
You can use Imixs workflow to control access to a process instance in a fine-grained way using an ACL. This includes the read and write access for users and roles. The ACL can be defined via the BPMN model for each Task or Event separately.

## The Architecture
The architecture of the Imixs-Workflow engine provides different basic concepts to simplify the development of business applications.
 
### The Workitem
A running process instance inside a Workflow Management System is called a '*Workitem*'. Each workitem is assigned to a Task in the BPMN model and can contain several business information.
If a Workitem is still in process, the Workitem is called a '*running process instance*'. After a process instance is finished the workitem is '*closed*'. 
Imixs Workflow provides an [XML schema](core/xml/index.html) to translate all workflow and business information of a process instance into an open and compatible data format. As a result, business data can be safely archived with Imixs-Workflow for long periods of time.

### The Process Model
The process model (or workflow model) defines what state a process instance can present during its life-cycle. Each time a workitem is processed, the workflow management system synchronizes the status (Task) with the process instance based on the BPMN model.

### The Workflow Engine
The Imixs-Workflow engine persists and controls the process instance into a database. The Workflow Engine ensures that a workitem is always in sync with the process model. The Imixs-Workflow engine supports a Plugin-API to implement different function blocks of a workflow management system. 
This includes, for example: 

* Access Controll
* Routing 
* E-Mail Notification
* Versioning
* Business Rules
* Reporting 
* Archiving


### Tasklists
A Workflow Management System provides various views of all running process instances. A 'tasklist' contains all open tasks from the view of an individual actor. Imixs-Workflow provides a lot of different views to navigate through the running process instances. 
  
 
## Getting started...
There are several ways how you can benefit from Imixs-Workflow. The following section gives you a short guideline how to find out the best way to use Imixs-Workflow in your own project.
 
### Using the Imixs-Workflow Engine out of the Box
Using Imixs-Workflow out of the Box is a good starting point to run the workflow engine without modification or Java EE development. 
You can start with the [Imixs-Microservice Project](https://github.com/imixs/imixs-microservice) which can be deployed in a Java EE Application server or by simply starting a [Docker Container](https://hub.docker.com/r/imixs/imixs-microservice/). 

If you want to develop a business application or embed the Imixs-Workflow engine into an existing project, you can also start with the [Imixs-Workflow Sample Application](sampleapplication.html) which gives a good starting point to develop a new project from scratch. 

Before you start developing with Imixs-Workflow, consider the following:
 
  * Provide a database where the workflow data can be stored
  * Configure a [security realm](./deployment/security.html) for granting access to different actors
  * Design a workflow model using the [Imixs-Workflow-Modeler](./modelling/index.html) 
  * Deploy the workflow application on an application server
  


### Using Imixs-Workflow in a Java EE Project 
Using Imixs-Workflow in a Java EE project is the typical way to extend your own java project with the functionality of a workflow engine.  In this kind of usage you develop your own workflow application. Inside your application you integrate the Imixs-Workflow Engine to provide the typical functionality of a Workflow Management System. 

To integrate Imixs-Workflow engine in an JEE application consider the following steps: 
 
  * Add the Imixs-Workflow jar files to your application. 
  * Add the Imixs-RestService into your application. 
  * Deploy your application together with the Imixs-Workflow on a application server

Read the [Deployment Guide](./deployment/deployment_guide.html) about how to deploy the Imixs-Workflow engine into an enterprise application (EAR).  
   
### Contribute to the Imixs-Workflow project
You can also help in developing the Imixs-Workflow project or use the results of the project to implement new components. In this case you extend the implementation with additional features or just add a different behavior. So in different of the usage described before, you need more than a running instance of the Workflow  Engine or the Java EE libraries. In this kind of usage you should check out the source code packages from [GitHub](https://github.com/imixs/imixs-workflow) and set up a Java EE Project. The source code include also some JUnit tests which can help to test different behaviors of the engine.

See the [Imixs Workflow community site on GitHub](https://github.com/imixs/imixs-workflow) for source code or ask questions in the issue tracking tool.
